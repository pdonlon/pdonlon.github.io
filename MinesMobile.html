Opened tiles display the number of bombs touching them in a subtle white font over uniquely colored tiles. Each second that ticks by in the game is reflected by the accurate timer's minute hand, taking exaclty 60 seconds to fully make its way around the clock.</p>

While in open mode tap any tile to open it or long press to flag it. In flag mode tap any tile to flag it or long press to open it. A convenient vibration is fired when the long press is triggered so you don't have to pick up your finger to check. In any mode, when the amount of flags touching a tile is the same as its number displayed simply touch the tile and it will open the remaining tiles surrounding it.</p>
