                    <p class="lead">Became the head coach of the Amherst Badminton Club in the fall of 2012, since then the badminton club has been completely changed. The club was transformed from a social club with no structure or guidance to a collegiate competitor amoung the East Coast. With structured practices and formal instruction, players learn proper technique, strategy, attitude, and leadership on court. Since becoming head coach the club also became a part of the Intercollegiate Badminton Association and has began challenging rival colleges such as Williams College, Yale, and MIT. The club has also traveled to team collegiate tournaments in both Boston and New Jersey. </p>
